	<p id="parid">For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful

	<p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen
		or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>

	<p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is
		something you design for the present.</p>

	<p>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.</p>
